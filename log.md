# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 18, 2017
##### Introduction to Celery, Crontab, and Tar

**Today's Progress**: Got a simple Celery Python application up and gained a better understanding of how cron works. Also learned tar commands and crontab to schedule period backup files.

**Thoughts:** Cron was one of those things that has been on my list of things to learn since forever! The last time I tried to learn it (almost a year ago), it was way over my head. I am happy I finally got to it this time around as things made more sense. Today most of the work was spent on installing and configuring.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
