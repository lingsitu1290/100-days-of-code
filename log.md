# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 18, 2017
##### Introduction to Celery, Crontab, and Tar

**Today's Progress**: Got a simple Celery Python application up and gained a better understanding of how cron works. Also learned tar commands and crontab to schedule periodic backup files.

**Thoughts:** Cron was one of those things that has been on my list of things to learn since forever! The last time I tried to learn it (almost a year ago), it was way over my head. I am happy I finally got to it this time around. Today most of the work was spent on installing and configuring.

### Day 1: June 19, 2017
##### Celery Flask Integration and MERN Beginning

**Today's Progress**: Integrated celery into a Flask application so that a task runs when a user goes to a route. Aside from the celery work, I also put together an Express/Node application from a MERN tutorial on Lynda. This will be the first public documented work I have on MERN although I have been working on this stack for a bit. Disclaimer: work from celery and flask integration was accidentally deleted and didn't want to spend time to reload.

**Thoughts**: Really excited to re-learn MERN and to improve on React. Have to acknowledge that having exposure to multiple stacks really helped me see how the core of these frameworks are very similar. Even Rails doesn't seem as hocus pocus-y black magic-y anymore.

### Day 2: June 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continuing on MERN application. Worked through some EJS templating. Started to review React basics again including making a class component, props, and state.

**Thoughts**: Went back to reconfigured webpack, eslint, etc. Revisited yesterday's MERN introduction with install and configuring while progressing to React basics.

### Day 3: June 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Since React is the less familiar section of the MERN stack, I spent most of my time today solely on React without the noise of the Express and Node. Going through JSX and props again through another tutorial through Udemy. Also going through the application set up again with babel and webpack.

**Thoughts**: Having multiple explanations and repeating these concepts definitely help in the learning process.

### Day 4: June 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed array data structure code challenges. And continued on expanding on React.

**Thoughts**: Started to review code challenges again.

### Day 5: June 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed array data structure code challenges. Continued to work on MERN stack tutorials. Rendered sample json file into application.

**Thoughts**: Need to review permutations and combinations. In addition to reviewing recursion. One of the hardest concepts for me to understanding.
