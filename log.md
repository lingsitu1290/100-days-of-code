# 100 Days Of Code - Log

##### Introduction to Celery, Crontab, and Tar

**Today's Progress**: Got a simple Celery Python application up and gained a better understanding of how cron works. Also learned tar commands and crontab to schedule periodic backup files.

**Thoughts:** Cron was one of those things that has been on my list of things to learn since forever! The last time I tried to learn it (almost a year ago), it was way over my head. I am happy I finally got to it this time around. Today most of the work was spent on installing and configuring.

##### Celery Flask Integration and MERN Beginning

**Today's Progress**: Integrated celery into a Flask application so that a task runs when a user goes to a route. Aside from the celery work, I also put together an Express/Node application from a MERN tutorial on Lynda. This will be the first public documented work I have on MERN although I have been working on this stack for a bit. Disclaimer: work from celery and flask integration was accidentally deleted and didn't want to spend time to reload.

**Thoughts**: Really excited to re-learn MERN and to improve on React. Have to acknowledge that having exposure to multiple stacks really helped me see how the core of these frameworks are very similar. Even Rails doesn't seem as hocus pocus-y black magic-y anymore.

### Day 2: June 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continuing on MERN application. Worked through some EJS templating. Started to review React basics again including making a class component, props, and state.

**Thoughts**: Went back to reconfigured webpack, eslint, etc. Revisited yesterday's MERN introduction with install and configuring while progressing to React basics.
